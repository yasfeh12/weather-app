#Weather app

Knowing the weather before you travel is like being a smart traveler. It helps you get ready for your trip in the best way. Imagine you're excited for a beach holiday, but then it rains unexpectedly. Not fun, right? Checking the weather helps you pack the right things, like sunscreen or a raincoat. It's like a heads-up for what's going to happen. It also helps you plan what to do, so you don't end up doing beach stuff on a rainy day. So, before you go on your next trip, take a quick look at the weather forecast. It might save you from surprises and make your trip even more fun!this is why i used javascript , html and css to design this webpage. using an api this page can display the weasther information for any city for the next 5 days.

JavaScript plays a pivotal role in web development, enabling interactive and dynamic websites while extending its utility to server-side programming, mobile, desktop, and IoT applications. Its popularity, backed by a vast community and numerous libraries and frameworks, establishes it as a versatile and widely adopted language.

With compatibility across modern browsers, JavaScript facilitates asynchronous programming, enabling concurrent task execution for more responsive web applications. Personally, I've applied my JavaScript skills alongside HTML and CSS to develop a weather app that enables users to track the weather of any city for the next 5 days. I utilized weatherapi and day.js and formatted it to display the day and time each card for each day. i used a function to fetch the data of any city the user inputs and plugs that with the api-key and the watherapi url. i then used a function to dynamically display the data on the bootstrap card and used css to make the page look better. i used an event listner for when the user enters the city and submits it by clicking the search button which dynamically puts the city the user entereed into the fetch request. 

I employed an if statement to assign the correct class to each text area based on whether it's in the past, present, or future, ensuring accurate color representation. Finally, I utilized an onClick event selector to store user input text in local storage. This ensures that information inputted by the user is saved and not lost if the page is refreshed, provided the save button was clicked.

I encountered challenges with two aspects of this project: firstly, implementing dynamic color-changing for past, present, and future elements was challenging; and secondly, using jQuery and local storage to save and retrieve information presented difficulties. I sought guidance from resources such as W3Schools, YouTube tutorials, and received valuable support from colleagues to overcome these challenges

While working on this project, I encountered challenges and sought help from various resources such as www.w3schools.com, YouTube, and previous work. I also used Google to find templates and similar examples to achieve the desired functionality. Despite facing setbacks and having to restart the project a few times, I am content with the outcome. I will continue to debug and troubleshoot to address the issue of displaying high scores on the leaderboard. Although the high scores are successfully stored on the local drive, they are not currently being displayed on the scoreboard HTML page.

(Important!!! atm you are asked thgwe questions twice once when you first load the page and once when you click generate password. )
